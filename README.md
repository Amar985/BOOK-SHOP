The inventory of books offered at a bookstore is kept up to date.

Author, title, price, publisher, and stock position are all included in the list.

When a customer requests a book, the salesperson enters the title and author, and the system scans the list to see if it is available.

If it isn't, a suitable notice is displayed.

If that's the case, the system displays the book's information and asks for the quantity of copies needed.
